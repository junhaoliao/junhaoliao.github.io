**Have you ever tried to write code using a remote control connection (VNC) in this course?** *(required)*

- Yes, establishing a remote control connection (VNC) is effortless.
- Yes, but the setup is just too challenging.
- No, I use IDEs (Code Lite, XCode, CLion, VS Code...) on my own computer.
- No, I use the Virtual Machine (VM) provided by the course instead.
- A mixed of the above.

**Have you used Linux before taking this course?** *(required)*

- No, I never heard of it before taking the course.
- No, why should I used it if Microsoft Windows and Apple MacOS are already available?
- Yes, I installed the system and use it occasionally.
- Yes, it's actually my daily driver.

**What are some pain points of coding in this course, in the context of working from home?** *(required)*

- [ ] Terminal Shell / Command Line
- [ ] File Transfer
- [ ] IDE Setup
- [ ] Viewing Auto-tester results
- [ ] Keeping my lab password in mind
- [ ] Setting up a remote control connection

**Given the current available resources, do you think your coding efficiency will ramp up, if you were able to write code in the lab?** *(required)*

- Yes, this remote working style has hindered my ability to code.
- No, I actually prefer working at home.
- It has never been a reality so I don't know.

**Have you ever heard of UG_Remote? (http://remote.junhao.ca)** *(required)*
